          personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If
          applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your

          <Bold>Can I update or correct my information?</Bold>
          <br />
          The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the
          information we collect depend on your relationship with us. Personnel
          may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal
          company employment policies. Customers have the right to request the
          restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable
          information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or
          correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your
          preferences with respect to communications and other information you
          receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information
          maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following
          paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections,
          changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we
          maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in
          accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction,
          change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take
          reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your
          identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You
          are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password
          and account information at all times. You should be aware that it is
          not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the
          information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back
          up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that
          a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will
          be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving
          your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively
          use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected,
          changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent
          reasonably and technically practicable. If you are an end user and
          wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you,
          you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a
          customer.
